# checking for small deformation
# A single element is incrementally stretched in the in the z and x directions
# This causes the return direction to be along the hypersurface sigma_I = sigma_II,
# and the resulting stresses are checked to lie on the expected yield surface
#
# tensile_strength is set to 1Pa, tip_smoother = 0.5, edge_smoother = 25degrees
# Then A + B + C = 0.609965
